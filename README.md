## MicroView AI: Leveraging Large Vision-Language Models in an Augmentative Raspberry Pi‚ÄìBased System for Urine Microscopy Analysis

This is my undergraduate thesis project for my degree in **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering** at **Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM)**, where I served as the primary software developer while collaborating with a team. The project aims to develop a cost-effective, Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased augmentative microscopy urinalysis system enhanced with Vision-Language Models to democratize access to reliable urinalysis diagnostic automation for resource-constrained laboratories.

## üìã Project Overview

With the recent advancement of foundational models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and other large language models, there has been a paradigm shift in AI capabilities, particularly in multimodal understanding and natural language generation. These Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in analyzing complex visual data while providing human-interpretable explanations. In the context of medical diagnostics, this presents an unprecedented opportunity to explore whether these advanced AI systems can revolutionize automated urinalysis analysis. **MicroView AI** is a cost-effective, Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased urine microscopy system enhanced with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that investigates the application of state-of-the-art AI to urine sediment microscopy, exploring their potential to provide accurate, explainable, and cost-effective analysis that could democratize access to reliable diagnostic automation for resource-constrained laboratories. Unlike expensive commercial analyzers, this approach emphasizes both affordability and transparency, addressing the critical gap in diagnostic access by providing a practical, trustworthy tool that bridges the gap between manual and fully automated analysis.

### Research Impact
This research contributes to the advancement of accessible medical diagnostics and demonstrates the potential of Visual-Language Models in healthcare technologies. The findings provide a foundation for democratizing reliable urinalysis and addressing the persistent access-accuracy gap in diagnostic services, especially in third world countries where access to such advanced diagnostic machines is limited due to high costs and infrastructure requirements. By combining low-cost hardware with transparent AI, this work positions itself as a viable step toward ensuring diagnostic equity across diverse clinical settings.
