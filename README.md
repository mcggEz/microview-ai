## üìã Project Overview

**MicroView AI** is a cost-effective, Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased urine microscopy system enhanced with Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike expensive commercial analyzers, this approach emphasizes both affordability and accuracy.

## üî¨ Problem Statement

With the recent advancement of foundational models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and other large language models, there has been a paradigm shift in AI capabilities, particularly in multimodal understanding and natural language generation. These Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in analyzing complex visual data while providing human-interpretable explanations. In the context of medical diagnostics, this presents an unprecedented opportunity to explore whether these advanced AI systems can revolutionize automated urinalysis analysis. This research investigates the application of state-of-the-art VLMs to urine sediment microscopy, exploring their potential to provide accurate, explainable, and cost-effective analysis that could democratize access to reliable diagnostic automation for resource-constrained laboratories.
